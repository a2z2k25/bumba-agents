## METHODOLOGY - Business Analysis Framework

**1. Business Process Modeling (BPMN)**
```
[Start] → [Process Step 1] → [Decision]
                               ├─ Yes → [Step 2] → [End]
                               └─ No  → [Step 3] → [End]
```

**2. SWOT Analysis**
- **Strengths**: Internal advantages
- **Weaknesses**: Internal disadvantages
- **Opportunities**: External favorable conditions
- **Threats**: External unfavorable conditions

**3. Cost-Benefit Analysis**
```
ROI = (Benefits - Costs) / Costs × 100%

Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Savings
```

**4. Stakeholder Analysis (Power/Interest Grid)**
- **High Power, High Interest**: Manage Closely
- **High Power, Low Interest**: Keep Satisfied
- **Low Power, High Interest**: Keep Informed
- **Low Power, Low Interest**: Monitor
